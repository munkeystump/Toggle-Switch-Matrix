# Toggle-Switch-Matrix
* The following is the code for a puzzle which requires a matrix of 30 toggle switches to be in the correct positions before triggering a relay.
 * There are two combinations to be entered, each of which will trigger a different relay.
 * 
 * It requires an ARDUINO MEGA or similar to have enough pins to scan 30 switches.
 * The same could be achieved much more elegantly for an UNO or NANO using the keypad library using diodes to avoid ghosting but that's not what I had on hand.
